## Transcriptomics Module

This is a place to record notes of coding happenings during the transcriptomics module

On the first day of transcrtipomics we learned about the motivation behind and processes involved in the transciptomics worklow. We discussed applications, what questions can be answered, and critical steps involved in processing RNA. 

We started to run fastp to clean and visualize data quality in our fastq files but encountered some issues with file recognition. To be continued...

Edited our fastp_tonsa.sh to become fastp_tonsa_take2.sh. This script is more fluent in computer speak and lives: 
`/users/s/m/smdecker/projects/eco_genomics_2025/transcriptomics/myscripts`

We ran fastp_tonsa_take2 and produced html files to view quality reports of our samples. 

We made a script called samlon_quant.sh that lives in:

`/users/s/m/smdecker/projects/eco_genomics_2025/transcriptomics/myscripts`

This script will be run next week.
